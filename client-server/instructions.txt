bootstrap compilation instructions
    1. g++ bootstrap.cpp -o bootstrap
    2. ./bootstrap

client compilation instructions
    1. g++ client.cpp -o client
    2. ./client -p 5555 -s 127.0.0.1

    The client application takes 2 arguments, the port and host of the server to connect to. These values are currently
    set to 5555 and 127.0.0.1 (localhost) respectively, but the server port can be changed. Client executables can be ran once
    the bootstrap server is running. The server will await for a connection and request a host IP input from the client. 
    This functionality only here to show the multi-thread capability and will not be there in the future. Once a host name is 
    sent, the client reads the json file "peers.json" and sends the buffered string to the server. The server receives the 
    string and currently writes it to "known_peers.json". The server must be able to parse the string and update a host's
    known peers and resemble the structure below. In this case, 127.0.0.1 represents the client's hostname. The json.hpp file is
    a compiled header file from a downloaded distrubution of jsoncpp. Follow https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp for
    more info on jsoncpp.
